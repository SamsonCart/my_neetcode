Welcome to my Neetcode journey! 

As a Computer Science student at the University of Florida, it is imperative that I 
demonstrate mastery of my recently aquired coding skills, and the general consensus 
amoung my peers and professors is to show that I am applying these skills through programs
like Neetcode. This is a repositoy that helps track my progress and thoughts.
